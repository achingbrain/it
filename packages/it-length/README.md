Counts the number of items in an (async)iterable.

N.b. will consume the iterable

## Example

```javascript
import length from 'it-length'

// This can also be an iterator, generator, etc
const values = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

const res = length(values)

console.info(res) // 5
```

Async sources must be awaited:

```javascript
import length from 'it-length'

const values = async function * () {
  yield * [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
}

const res = await length(values())

console.info(res) // 5
```

# Install

```console
$ npm i it-length
```

## Browser `<script>` tag

Loading this module through a script tag will make it's exports available as `ItLength` in the global namespace.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/it-length/dist/index.min.js"></script>
```
