Mostly useful for tests or when you want to be explicit about consuming an iterable without doing anything with any yielded values.

## Example

```javascript
import drain from 'it-drain'

// This can also be an iterator, generator, etc
const values = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

drain(values)
```

Async sources must be awaited:

```javascript
import drain from 'it-drain'

const values = async function * {
  yield * [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
}

await drain(values())
```

# Install

```console
$ npm i it-drain
```
