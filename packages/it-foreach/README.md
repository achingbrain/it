Calls a function for each value in an (async)iterable.

The function can be sync or async.

Async functions can be awaited on so may slow down processing of the (async)iterable.

## Example

```javascript
import each from 'it-foreach'
import drain from 'it-drain'

// This can also be an iterator, generator, etc
const values = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

// prints [0, 0], [1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3], [4, 4]
const arr = drain(
  each(values, console.info)
)
```

Async sources and callbacks must be awaited:

```javascript
import each from 'it-foreach'
import drain from 'it-drain'

const values = async function * () {
  yield * [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
}

// prints [0, 0], [1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3], [4, 4]
const arr = await drain(
  each(values(), console.info)
)
```

# Install
