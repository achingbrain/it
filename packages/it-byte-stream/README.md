This module makes it easy to send and receive bytes over streams.

## Example

```typescript
import { byteStream } from 'it-byte-stream'

const stream = byteStream(duplex)

// read the next chunk
const bytes = await stream.read()

// read the next five bytes
const fiveBytes = await stream.read(5)

// write bytes into the stream
await stream.write(Uint8Array.from([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]))
```

# Install

```console
$ npm i it-byte-stream
```

## Browser `<script>` tag
