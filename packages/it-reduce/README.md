> Reduces the values yielded by an (async) iterable

Mostly useful for tests or when you want to be explicit about consuming an iterable without doing anything with any yielded values.

## Install

```sh
$ npm install --save it-reduce
```

## Usage

```javascript
const reduce = require('it-reduce')

// This can also be an iterator, async iterator, generator, etc
const values = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

const result = await reduce(values, (acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0)

console.info(result) // 10
```
